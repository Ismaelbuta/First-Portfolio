            <ol>
            <li>After getting my associates I wanted to switch my major to computer science but didn't want to go through another few years of debt so I did some reasearch and found Thinkful.</li>
            <li>I applied and got into the program</li>
            <li>Now Thinkful challenges me and rewards me with satisfaction as I go through and complete modules.</li>
